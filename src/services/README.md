# Data Fixing Service Documentation

## Overview

The `DataFixerService.ts` is responsible for automatically fixing data issues in the booking data before it's used for matching with expense data. This is implemented as a TypeScript service that processes booking data after parsing and applies necessary normalizations to ensure accurate matching.

## Problem Statement

During development, we identified several data normalization issues:

1. **Card Type Mismatch**: There was a discrepancy between the expected Mastercard bookings count (934) and the actual detected count (14). This was due to the raw data containing the value "MasterCard" but not being properly normalized to "Mastercard" in the `cardTypeNormalized` field.

2. **Booking Type Classification**: Some booking types were not being correctly identified and normalized (Flight, Hotel, Car, Rail).

## Solution

The DataFixerService addresses these issues by:

1. Automatically applying fixes during the data parsing process
2. Ensuring consistent field normalization for accurate statistics and matching

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Card Type Normalization

The service checks for the value "MasterCard" in the raw data's "Credit Card Network" field and normalizes it to "Mastercard" in the `cardTypeNormalized` field:

```typescript
if (booking.rawData && booking.rawData['Credit Card Network'] === 'MasterCard') {
  booking.cardTypeNormalized = 'Mastercard';
  masterCardFixed++;
}
```

#### 2. Booking Type Classification

The service ensures booking types are correctly set based on the raw Type field:

```typescript
if (booking.rawData && booking.rawData['Type']) {
  const type = booking.rawData['Type'];

  if (type.toLowerCase().includes('flight')) {
    booking.bookingTypeNormalized = 'Flight';
    typeFixed++;
  } else if (type.toLowerCase().includes('hotel')) {
    booking.bookingTypeNormalized = 'Hotel';
    typeFixed++;
  } // ...and so on for other types
}
```

### Integration

The service is integrated into the application workflow:

1. The `applyDataFixes` function is called immediately after parsing booking data
2. It returns both the fixed bookings and statistics about applied fixes
3. The application uses the fixed data for all subsequent operations

```typescript
// In App.tsx during parsing:
const { fixedBookings, stats } = applyDataFixes(bookings);
bookings = fixedBookings;
```

## Benefits

- **Automatic Correction**: No user interaction required - fixes are applied automatically during parsing
- **Consistent Data**: Ensures data fields are properly normalized for accurate matching
- **Transparent Processing**: Debug logging shows how many fixes were applied and the resulting statistics
- **Type Safety**: Implemented in TypeScript with proper interfaces for type safety

## Testing

Testing shows that with these fixes applied:
- The Mastercard bookings count now correctly shows 934 bookings (increased from 14)
- Booking types are correctly identified and normalized
- The Booking Type Summary display shows consistent values regardless of pagination

## Future Improvements

If additional data normalization issues are identified, they can be added to the `applyDataFixes` function in a similar pattern to the existing fixes.
